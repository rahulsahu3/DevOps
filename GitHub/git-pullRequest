Git Pull requests

There are 2 ways to generate a pull request

1: This involves forking the repo and then making the changes and then creating a pull Request with the original repo to merge the changes

2: In this; clone the repo and then create a seperate branch;
	In this branch, you will make your changes and then push it
	After you have pushed your changes; then you will create a pull request that will be compared with the base branch and merged accordingly

To push a branch to the remote repo, you need to have access to that repo
