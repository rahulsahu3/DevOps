In Linux	 
	windows is available by hostname[prem-PC] 			check using hostname
	hosts are available to one another as defined in /etc/hosts; nginx plays no part whatsoever
				it's just hosted on port 80 like any other service; can be moved to any other port
				both ping and curl
	prem-PC can be accessed by name but vice versa is not possible
	
in Windows 
	can ping self hostname
	linux VMs not accessible via hostname
	
Adding Hostname in Windows
https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/
	Opem CMD as administrator
	open C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts in notepad
	add the required details; it will be same as in linux systems
	save; Everything should be okay now
	
	
main nginx.conf will have 
	include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
add file.conf in conf.d

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name ussl-grafana.usanainc.com;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://gweb:3000;						--->> address to go
  }
}


server {
  listen 8080;
  server_name _;
  location / {
    proxy_pass https://ind-blr-k8smaster.dubey.org:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/;
  }
}

OR ADD PATH IN NGINX.CONF IF YOU WANT ON SAME PORT BUT DIFFERENT ADDRESS

    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        listen       [::]:80 default_server;
        server_name  _;
        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        location / {
        }
          location /dashboard {
            proxy_pass https://ind-blr-k8smaster.dubey.org:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/;
          }
        error_page 404 /404.html;
            location = /40x.html {
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
        }
    }
